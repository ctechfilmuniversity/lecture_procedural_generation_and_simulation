# Violence was always an option.


I'm very happy with this rendering! There are still some ugly parts and the behavior of the shards is less than ideal. The smoke-sand is also not-so-great, but the overall visual fidelity is a big improvement over my previous attempts. I was jumping back-and-forth between multiple tutorials. The smoke was done by placing a Billowy Smoke and changing the input volume to the debris that gets generated on collision. I'm starting to REALLY enjoy Houdini, though I had to render overnight.
