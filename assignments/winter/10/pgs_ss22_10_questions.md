## Question 1: Wrap-Up

* How would you rate the difficulty of this lecture from 1 (far too easy) to 5 (far too difficult)?
    * 3. I'd would have preferred a bigger challenge regarding math and the implementation of papers. 
* How would you rate the amount of work you had to put into this lecture so far from 1 (no work at all) to 5 (far too much work)?
  * 3. Like many of us, I also often did more than was expected, but that's my own responsibility and the minimum requirements were easy to reach. 
* How well did the given time estimates for each session match the time you needed to complete the session?
  * Pretty accurate.
* What do you think about Houdini as tool to learn for a CTecht student? Is it valuable?
  * I mean Houdini is such an important industry tool, how could it not be valuable? I'm definitly happy that I know it now, even if it's just a tiny little bit. But I think that there are better learning environments because...
* What do you think about Houdini as a tool for this class? Does the work with Houdini connect to the theoretical topics reasonably?
  * ... Houdini's endless tools, nodes and settings can lead to decision paralysis. I think I'm personally past that stage, but now I feel that Houdini is taking care of too many things for me. For example I almost exclusively relied on the shelf tools and good render settings for my Forces submission and I don't think that's the goal of this class. Another major hinderance with Houdini are the limitations of the apprentice version, especially regarding the renderer and the non-existent export options. And then there are the error messages... Most of the time they are plain wrong and don't point towards the actual problem. I found myself trying to fix some errors a couple times, only to find out that they were caused by the limitations of the apprentice version. It's ok that you can't to everything with my free copy, but please be more clear Houdini.... Sometimes it just doesn't feel like professsional software. I have to deactivate all my antivirus software to even start the program. 
* Do you have any other ideas reading which tools and software packages to use for this class?
  * My short flirt with Blender was very pleasent, it has such a nice interface. And it's free! Of course Blender will never be as powerful as Houdini, but thanks to its large community there are many tutorials and addons for the kind of renderings Houdini is asscociated with. It'd be a great opportunity to learn some python along the way. I was also surprised by how easy and fun it was to set-up a basic particle system in Unity. Something like Jannis' final Unreal project would be super interesting as an exercise, Niagara/Cascade/Shader Graph shouldn't be underestimated! Looking in the complete opposite direction, I think that GLSL could've played a bigger role. I think that there is lots of value in writing your own noise functions for example, even if you're just following one of Inigos tutorials. Of course this would lead to less impressive submissions, but that's better than just connecting nodes and clicking on the shelf tools. My ideas seem to be all over the place... in the end, there will never be a perfect solution for everyone and that's ok. 
* Do you have any useful hints to pass on to future students, e.g. utility tools, further resources?
  * I think my own tutorial on exporting animations to Unity/Unreal is quite valuable. No future student should experience that much PAIN (I'm just joking). But for everything else, I found exactly the kind of tutorial I was looking for in no time. 
* What is your opinion regarding practical exercises in class? Do you think it would be helpful to substitute some of the theory parts with doing e.g. an Houdini exercise in class (there can be no additional time for the class though, it is "either...or")?
  * I think doing Houdini exercises in class would only lead to more mindless node-connecting. I prefer to take my time at home. 
* Which one was your favorite chapter, which one your least favorite?
  * The new fluids chapter is my favourite! This might seem weird because I didn't submit anything for that particular session, but that's because I'm saving it for my final cc2 project. I think it was very challenging in a good way and brough many of the previous topics together. My least favourite chapter would be Particles because I don't like particles. The video lecture was also very long and I prefer written tutorials in general. 
* Was there a topic missing and if so which one?
  * Too my own surprise, I took a liking to explosions after breaking so many things during the Dynamics exercise. So some pyro would be great ðŸ”¥. On a more serious note, I would have liked a greater focus on function design.  
* Please feel free to add any feedback you want to give!
  * Going into this class, I was expecting much more coding. I think my main takeaway here is that the big 3d packages like Houdini are unavoidable for professional visuals. Looking at all our results for the final exercise, I don't think we would have achieved these with Processing or shader programming. It's a bit of a though pill to swollow because I like the feeling (illusion?) of building everyhing myself, but in the end it's the result that matters and here I see such an improvement for everyone, looking back at the final cc1 exercise. I'll definitly think more procedural in the future! 


## Question 2: Personal Reflection

In order to make the best possible use of the lecture, please reflect on the following questions. No need to submit anything, this is just for you.

Does it makes sense for you

* ...to have procedural generation in your set of skills?
    * If yes, with which tool do you want to work with?
    * Create your own outputs / designs / setups
* ...to have Houdini in your set of skills?
    * If yes, pick a topic to look into...
    * ...or start with doing once a complete tour through Houdini.
    * Have a individualized setup of project structure, view layouts, rendering setup, etc.
    * Keep notes on your insights
    * Create your own outputs / designs / setups
    * Get as much as possible into the procedural work flow
    * Use the shelf tools as little as possible 
* ...to have fragment shader programming / glsl in your set of skills?
    * If yes, pick an environment
    * Come to the shader workshop
    * Think about converting the topics that we worked on with Houdini to glsl
    * Look at examples and understand them
    * Create your own outputs / designs

Choose your next steps depending on your answers.
