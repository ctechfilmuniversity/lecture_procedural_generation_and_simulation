## Question 1: Wrap-Up

* How would you rate the difficulty of this lecture from 1 (far too easy) to 5 (far too difficult)?
    * I think it is a 3.5 to 4.0. It totally depends on the topic. And in theory and while following scripts or tutorial it is all quite easy but starting to do those kind of things is quite hard and sometimes a bit intimidating (looking at complex papers etc.)
* How would you rate the amount of work you had to put into this lecture so far from 1 (no work at all) to 5 (far too much work)?
    * 3.5 - 4.0. I always needed at least the estimated time and sometimes the result at that point wouldn't have been very satisfying.
* How well did the given time estimates for each session match the time you needed to complete the session?
    * oh just answered that above...
* What do you think about Houdini as tool to learn for a CTecht student? Is it valuable?
    * I think Houdini is a great tool, and I would love to go deeper with it. But the renderer is really underwhelming. And underwhelming renders are not that rewarding. I liked the switch to shaders once. Such change of tools could be included even more, in my opinion. It really helps to see how global those concepts are.
* What do you think about Houdini as a tool for this class? Does the work with Houdini connect to the theoretical topics reasonably?
    * I think it is a good choice. I thought that Blender might be better since it's free and can produce nicer renders and combines all the 3D workflows, but then it is also nice to mix the node based and the text based approach, which doesn't work that seemlessly in Blender. So thumbs up for Houdini.
* Do you have any other ideas reading which tools and software packages to use for this class?
    * As I said. A switch of tools could also be nice. But also problematic, since it can also be frustrating. But picking up all kinds of tools is also a learning in itself. Overall I think the shader/Houdini switch works nicely. Maybe one could do one thing but with multiple tools. Or the class could decide individually which tool to use for a specific exercise, so that all together could afterwards discuss how to approach the same problem in different software?
* Do you have any useful hints to pass on to future students, e.g. utility tools, further resources?
    * no, nothing that isn't very popular anyway. I think Nature of Code is a good resource, The Art of Code (for shaders) and the Coding Adventure Videos by Sebatian Lague (maybe out of scope but inspirational and beautifully executed). 
* What is your opinion regarding practical exercises in class? Do you think it would be helpful to substitute some of the theory parts with doing e.g. an Houdini exercise in class (there can be no additional time for the class though, it is "either...or")?
    * I don't like in class exercises too much. I feel way more concentrated and less stressed when I am on my own and can go my own pace.
* Which one was your favorite chapter, which one your least favorite?
    * I liked the pattern session with the tiling/pattern/function (it was one session right?). And also the Dynamics Session. They both explained previously used concepts in a new and more comprehsnible way to me.
    The noise session was the least favorite to me, because it didn't add to much new information for me.
* Was there a topic missing and if so which one?
    * What I really would love to learn about proceural genereation is how to make a "model generator". By that I mean a how to build a system that generates a variety of differnet burgers, houses, cities, plants, book shelves etc. I don't know how I would approach that. But since it might involve modelling it probably also doesn't really fit here. It's just something i wold love to learn. Maybe a workshop would be cool.
* Please feel free to add any feedback you want to give!
    * I liked this course a lot! Thank you!


## Question 2: Personal Reflection

In order to make the best possible use of the lecture, please reflect on the following questions. No need to submit anything, this is just for you.

Does it makes sense for you

* ...to have procedural generation in your set of skills?
    * If yes, with which tool do you want to work with?
    * Create your own outputs / designs / setups
* ...to have Houdini in your set of skills?
    * If yes, pick a topic to look into...
    * ...or start with doing once a complete tour through Houdini.
    * Have a individualized setup of project structure, view layouts, rendering setup, etc.
    * Keep notes on your insights
    * Create your own outputs / designs / setups
    * Get as much as possible into the procedural work flow
    * Use the shelf tools as little as possible 
* ...to have fragment shader programming / glsl in your set of skills?
    * If yes, pick an environment
    * Come to the shader workshop
    * Think about converting the topics that we worked on with Houdini to glsl
    * Look at examples and understand them
    * Create your own outputs / designs

Choose your next steps depending on your answers.
