## My Inspirational Shader

This beautiful piece is called [Hologram/Iridescence Raymarching](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XlcBR7) by [Aj_](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/Aj_)

I really wanted to implement this shader in TBAG, but I just couldn't see through the jungle of math! The code isn't too long and I think I might be ready to tackle this one eventually ...

Another cool shader I found while browsing is the [Primordial Soup System](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/NssczB) by [davidar](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/davidar):

This one has different buffers and a lot of code. I really don't feel ready yet to understand something like this, but I really like it :)

## Time Annotations

The time we should spent on this assignment: <3h

I have started to precisely log the time I spent on homework assignments with a stop watch. I am strictly excluding coffee breaks etc, as well as the time it takes me to write these annotations. I log worked minutes from opening the readmes to closing all work related tabs/applications.

Task 1: Setup - This took me **8 minutes**.  
Why: I included the setup/starting of applications and clicked on the shadertoy link.

Task 2: Read Chapter 04 - Function Design - This took my **34 minutes**.  
Why: We have already discussed this in class. I also checked out Unity's functions for vector interpolation, as I have never really understood, but only used them :D Unity also has a [spherical lerp function](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Vector3.Slerp.html), which I still don't fully understand... (What does spherical mean *exactly*?)

Task 3: Brick Pattern - This took me **37 minutes**.  
Why: It takes a while to look through the concepts behind the code. I also had to look up [GL_FragCoord](https://docs.gl/sl4/gl_FragCoord) again, because coordinates are confusing (to me)...

Task 4: Experiments - This took me **x minutes**.  
Why:

Task 5: Inspiration - This took me **24 minutes**.  
Why: I had one example saved from another lecture and wanted to look for a new one as well. I also included the time taken for writing the readme.

Other: git etc - This took me **5 minutes**

**= in total it took me X hours and X minutes to complete this homework.**
