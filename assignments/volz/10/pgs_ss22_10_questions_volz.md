## Question 1: Wrap-Up

* How would you rate the difficulty of this lecture from 1 (far too easy) to 5 (far too difficult)?
  * I would rate it a 3. It was the perfect amout of challenge for me.  

* How would you rate the amount of work you had to put into this lecture so far from 1 (no work at all) to 5 (far too much work)?
  * 4. I mean it was a lot of work, but I think this course is incredibly useful and taught me an entirely new way of thinking about code.

* How well did the given time estimates for each session match the time you needed to complete the session?
  * I took a LOT longer for each session. Especially rendering and in the end ending up with a grainy result was frustrating.  

* What do you think about Houdini as tool to learn for a CTecht student? Is it valuable?
  * Houdini is incredibly valuable in teaching a node-based workflow. I used Houdini in some form for every project I did since we started learning it.

* What do you think about Houdini as a tool for this class? Does the work with Houdini connect to the theoretical topics reasonably?
  * I think Houdini is great because it gives you a glimpse into the crazy possibilities and libraries you can use to do stuff instead of coding everything yourself.  

* Do you have any other ideas reading which tools and software packages to use for this class?
  * A little TouchDesigner or Notch segment for live stuff, while still keeping Houdini would be nice.

* Do you have any useful hints to pass on to future students, e.g. utility tools, further resources?
  * Use the geometry spreadsheet often to keep track of whats happening.

* What is your opinion regarding practical exercises in class? Do you think it would be helpful to substitute some of the theory parts with doing e.g. an Houdini exercise in class (there can be no additional time for the class though, it is "either...or")?
  - Yes, some exercise where you can directly ask questions to the teacher would be VERY helpful.

* Was there a topic missing and if so which one?
  * I would have preferred getting more insight into using Houdinis powerful own-engine tools, which we mostly only did in the Dynamics session.  
  - The Tiling and Patterns session was nice to show how methodically one can think about all this and how much maths is behind it all, but I would have rather subsituted it with something more ***production near*** like fluids or e.g. procedural landscaping / city building

* Please feel free to add any feedback you want to give!


## Question 2: Personal Reflection

In order to make the best possible use of the lecture, please reflect on the following questions. No need to submit anything, this is just for you.

Does it makes sense for you

* ...to have procedural generation in your set of skills?
    * If yes, with which tool do you want to work with?
    * Create your own outputs / designs / setups
* ...to have Houdini in your set of skills?
    * If yes, pick a topic to look into...
    * ...or start with doing once a complete tour through Houdini.
    * Have a individualized setup of project structure, view layouts, rendering setup, etc.
    * Keep notes on your insights
    * Create your own outputs / designs / setups
    * Get as much as possible into the procedural work flow
    * Use the shelf tools as little as possible 
* ...to have fragment shader programming / glsl in your set of skills?
    * If yes, pick an environment
    * Come to the shader workshop
    * Think about converting the topics that we worked on with Houdini to glsl
    * Look at examples and understand them
    * Create your own outputs / designs

Choose your next steps depending on your answers.
