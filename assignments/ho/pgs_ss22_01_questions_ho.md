## Questions 1 - Topics & Syllabus

* Which of the chapter topics given in the syllabus are of most interest to you? Why?

  * I'm generally interested in learning Houdini, and the topics from the syllabus that interest me specifically are Agency and Complex Systems. I'm interested in those topics because I am least familiar with them, and would like to learn more about programming agents as well as rendering fluid simulations. I think the beauty in procedural systems is often in ordered complexity, so I am very interested in learning more about those types of systems.
* Are there any further topics in regard to procedural generation and simulation that would interest you?

  * Although I know the focus of this course is more on the abstract design aspects of procedural generation, I would be interested in a course that dives deeper into the realistic rendering capabilities of Houdini.
* Which tool would you personally prefer to use for the practical tasks (e.g. Houdini, Unreal, Unity, Maya, Blender, JavaScript, p5, GLSL, ...)?
  * I would like to use Houdini, Blender, Javascript, GLSL, Touch Designer, and if possible, try to incorporate some Unreal (that might be a reach goal) 
* How would you rate your level of experience with SideFX's Houdini?
    * [ ] I have only used it in TI
    * [x] Novice
    * [ ] Intermediate
    * [ ] Advanced
    * [ ] God-like

## Questions 2 - Procedural Generation

Briefly in your own words: how would you explain your nanny what *procedural generation* means?

* Procedural generation is like writing a recipe for someone else to cook a very complex dish, but in this case, the dish is a piece of art, and the chef is a computer that executes your code, or recipe. By knowing how the computer likes to cook, we can modify the recipe to get the dish to turn out the way we like, but there's also some elements of randomness or unexpected outcomes that might actually inspire us and make the dish better.

## Questions 3 - Patterns

### 3.1 Seeing Patterns

Take at least three pictures of natural patterns and at least three pictures of man-made ones (patterns can be two or three dimensional). Try to include at least one pattern with self-similarity. Taking the pictures with your smart phone is just fine. Link all images in this markdown file.

### 3.2 Understanding and Implementing Patterns

Write for one of your pattern images a generating algorithm in pseudo-code or code. Submit the code below.

### 3.3 Seeing Faces

As an exercise to see and understand the environment around you (and to have some fun ðŸ˜Š), try to find at least two faces. Link all images in this file.

## Questions 4 - Abstraction

### 4.1 Abstraction in Art

Chose one "traditional" painting, which is inspirational to you. The image can come from the script or you can refer to any artists or image you like.  

Explain briefly what you like about the painting and how it might inspire you for your own work.

### 4.2 Abstracted Artistic Expression in CGI

Chose one CG image, which you like and of which you think that it has an artistic quality to it. The image doesn't need to be from the script, again you can chose any CGI image you like (it should use 3D graphics). You can find more examples in the [Summary of Artists](../../02_scripts/pgs_ss22_01_intro_script.md#summary-of-artists) section.  

Explain briefly what you like about the image and why you consider it to be somewhat a pice of art.
