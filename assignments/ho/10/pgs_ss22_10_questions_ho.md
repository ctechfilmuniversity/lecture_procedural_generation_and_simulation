## Question 1: Wrap-Up

* How would you rate the difficulty of this lecture from 1 (far too easy) to 5 (far too difficult)?
  * I would rate the difficulty of the course a 4 / 5, given that we had little experience in Houdini and that there is **a lot** to learn in the program!

* How would you rate the amount of work you had to put into this lecture so far from 1 (no work at all) to 5 (far too much work)?
  * I would say the amount of work was also 4 / 5 - it was challenging to complete the tutorials in the given amount of time in the READMEs but I felt that you need a certain amount of time in program to understand how to do things, especially for a complex program like Houdini.

* How well did the given time estimates for each session match the time you needed to complete the session?
  * The estimated time was generally too low for the amount of time I spent completing the tutorials (even just completing the basic tutorial, not modifying it creatively). Much of the extra time came from re-watching sections of the tutorial multiple times, so if the number of hours in the READMEs was adjusted to include the amount of time re-watching sections of tutorials and doing outside research it might help us plan our work time better. I felt that I overshot the allotted time every time by about 20 - 30%.
* What do you think about Houdini as tool to learn for a CTecht student? Is it valuable?
  * Houdini is super valuable as a CTech student, and I think it would be a loss to not have a class on it in the program. Before the course, I had heard about the difficulty of learning Houdini, and it was a bit intimidating to approach it, but I felt that PGS helped mitigate some of that apprehension. I'll keep using Houdini in the future, and I felt that the course was pretty valuable to get a first taste of the potential of Houdini.

* What do you think about Houdini as a tool for this class? Does the work with Houdini connect to the theoretical topics reasonably?
  * I think Houdini does make sense for this class, not only as an industry standard program, but also a super powerful program for simulation. However, I wish that Houdini would provide a better renderer, or the option to connect to other renderers without an expensive license, since it would be much more satisfying to generate higher res images rendered more quickly on the GPU. For those new to 3D packages, it might be off-putting to have a bad first experience with rendering. As for the theoretical concepts, Houdini does cover them reasonably - I think we could do more in Houdini itself rather than go into GLSL for tiling, for example.

* Do you have any other ideas reading which tools and software packages to use for this class?
  * I would recommend Blender as a procedural creation tool, as it now has powerful geometry nodes and scripts can be written in Python. I would also recommend Touch Designer, as it teaches some of the same concepts of node-based simulation with a much faster feedback loop and more transparent insight into what each step is doing. In Touch, we can render out each step of the node graph in parallel (without having to switch back and forth) and see exactly how it's affecting the final output. Not having to wait on renders to complete and having real-time feedback speeds up the learning curve significantly. Since the terminology is nearly identical to Houdini, it might make sense to start off with Touch to get a general overview of node-based workflows and CHOPs, SOPs, TOPs, etc. before moving on to the more advanced Houdini. I felt much more familiar with the interface and concepts of Houdini coming from Touch.

* Do you have any useful hints to pass on to future students, e.g. utility tools, further resources?
  * This rigid body simulation helped: [Steven Knipping - Rigid Body Simulation](https://www.cgcircuit.com/tutorial/applied-houdini---rigids-i-version-2.0)

* What is your opinion regarding practical exercises in class? Do you think it would be helpful to substitute some of the theory parts with doing e.g. an Houdini exercise in class (there can be no additional time for the class though, it is "either...or")?
  * I think it was good to do the practical exercises outside of class, with tutorials, since we could spend more time understanding each step better. Exercises in class, especially with code, can lead to some students falling behind in the exercise and others being far ahead which can be frustrating.

* Which one was your favorite chapter, which one your least favorite?
  * My favorite chapter was the particle chapter, since it combined much of what we learned in the previous chapter into a nice looking result. I think my least favorite was tiling, and I felt that the detour into GLSL was a bit out of place (maybe it would be better in another workshop or class). The most difficult chapter was fluids, and I'm still not sure I understand how to implement them.

* Was there a topic missing and if so which one?
  * I wish we could spend more time on the later chapters, maybe spending 2 weeks on fluids instead of doing tilings or combining 'functions' and 'beauty in math'. Other than that, I wish we could look into more volumetric effects in general.

* Please feel free to add any feedback you want to give!


## Question 2: Personal Reflection

In order to make the best possible use of the lecture, please reflect on the following questions. No need to submit anything, this is just for you.

Does it makes sense for you

* ...to have procedural generation in your set of skills?
    * If yes, with which tool do you want to work with?
    * Create your own outputs / designs / setups
* ...to have Houdini in your set of skills?
    * If yes, pick a topic to look into...
    * ...or start with doing once a complete tour through Houdini.
    * Have a individualized setup of project structure, view layouts, rendering setup, etc.
    * Keep notes on your insights
    * Create your own outputs / designs / setups
    * Get as much as possible into the procedural work flow
    * Use the shelf tools as little as possible 
* ...to have fragment shader programming / glsl in your set of skills?
    * If yes, pick an environment
    * Come to the shader workshop
    * Think about converting the topics that we worked on with Houdini to glsl
    * Look at examples and understand them
    * Create your own outputs / designs

Choose your next steps depending on your answers.
