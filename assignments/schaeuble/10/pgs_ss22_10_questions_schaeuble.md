# Session 10 Questions


### How would you rate the difficulty of this lecture from 1 (far too easy) to 5 (far too difficult)?

### How would you rate the amount of work you had to put into this lecture so far from 1 (no work at all) to 5 (far too much work)?

### How well did the given time estimates for each session match the time you needed to complete the session?
I think if it came down to fairly accurately tracking the time spent actually implementing on our end, most estimates were fairly accurate. 
Sometimes it wasn't for example in the tutorial that was using a different version of Houdini, so certain nodes / UI menus were not there for us.
Pretty sure this was the dynamics / sphere breaking tute. 

### What do you think about Houdini as tool to learn for a CTech student? Is it valuable?
I think it is because it introduces us to PGS in a powerful way where we can both see procedural node based approaches and code based approaches in action. 

### What do you think about Houdini as a tool for this class? Does the work with Houdini connect to the theoretical topics reasonably?
Yes, although I found that we used the attribute wrangle a lot, but because one processes was often isolated from the next attribute wrangle process, it became unclear how everything was working together. Also the idea of variable scope really screwed me in the end... 
Essentially until the very last class I thought that each attribute wrangle had its own variable scope, which in a sense makes some kind of sense as a newb as each attribute wrangel could be seen as sitting within its own code block... 

When I realised this, everything became a lot clearer. I'm sure it was something that you mentioned, but its a small bit of information with large ramifications when dealing with software that abstracts the usability of code. So maybe its worth hammering in a few more times throughout the tutorials / classes / scripts. 

### Do you have any other ideas reading which tools and software packages to use for this class?
I really enjoyed using Blender. It was much more approachable and less daunting in Python. 

### Do you have any useful hints to pass on to future students, e.g. utility tools, further resources?
Write down somewhere where you can easily reference; what a clear, defined and practical definition of procedural generation is. 

### What is your opinion regarding practical exercises in class? Do you think it would be helpful to substitute some of the theory parts with doing e.g. an Houdini exercise in class (there can be no additional time for the class though, it is "either...or")?
I think the current structure is great. Wouldn't change it. Except that at least somehow having some of the homework review at the end of the class, to save more brain juice for the class content. 

### Which one was your favorite chapter, which one your least favorite?
Pretty hard pick (üëè) but I'd say functions was my favorite because it really honed in on how to use functions in a design scenario.
Least favorite would probably be fluids because the content was very difficult (compared to the other classes, and also in general for me), but the topic is so damn cool! So it was sort of bitter sweet, like staring at the sun. Because I fully respect how complicated fluid dynamics actually is, but I wonder if there is some way to abstract it to a point where we implement it with some library / built in functions, and just have the *gist* of fluid dynamics taught to us as theory.

### Was there a topic missing and if so which one?
Perhaps landscape building (but I have a vague memory you avoided this for a reason - maybe too overdone?).
Or procedurally building an architectural structure (city building, house, spaceship). But maybe this would be too much for one topic.

### Please feel free to add any feedback you want to give!
Maybe doing one of the classes in Blender could be cool so as to give a taste of an alternate path in programs.
Otherwise, tip top! Loved it üôå
