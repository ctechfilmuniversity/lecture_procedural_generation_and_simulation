I chose the navier-stokes implementation knowing it would be hard, but it was much harder for me than expected. 

1. first read through the pdf again but mostly got lost.   
2. watched the numberphile video to see if that helped me understand the code, was still too much. 
3. tried to implement Mike Ash's code but couldn't figure out easily enough how to replace some of the functions he was using that were not part of openFrameworks by default such as calloc, malloc, etc.
4. tried to implement Dan Shiffmans code by copy / pasting and rewriting, but the differences in code structure between processing / C++ got me very confused. 
5. tried to install and run the examples of ofxMSAFluids by Memo but got continuous errors from within the dependencies such as `'hitTest' marked 'override' but does not override any member functions` and other such things that I tried briefly to fix, which just resulted in other errors. 
6. went back to trying to implement the code from coding train by following what he was doing and thinking about what he was doing with the code and then trying to translate it into c++ (instead of copy pasting and changing without context of what was really being done), but got fed up. Just don't know enough c++ to be able to translate code.
   
In the end I spent 2.5 hours coding, 20 min of extra research and 30 mins reading the pdf. Wanted to aim for 3 hours coding, but realistically I'm not going to get any further. Will focus on other stuff and if there's enough time before July 31st I may have another look.
