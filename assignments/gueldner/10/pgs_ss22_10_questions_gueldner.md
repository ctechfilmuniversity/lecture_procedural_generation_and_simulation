## Question 1: Wrap-Up

* How would you rate the difficulty of this lecture from 1 (far too easy) to 5 (far too difficult)?
> I would rate the difficulty a 3 because the scope of the assignments are for each individual person to decide.

* How would you rate the amount of work you had to put into this lecture so far from 1 (no work at all) to 5 (far too much work)?
> I would rate the amount of work a 3, probably because I had fun doing it and liked to spend time making my renderings better 
> or figuring something out that I have been struggling with.

* How well did the given time estimates for each session match the time you needed to complete the session?
> It depends. When I had a tutorial to follow it usually worked out pretty quickly. The assignments that were the most 
> open and creatively challenging took longer.

* What do you think about Houdini as tool to learn for a CTecht student? Is it valuable?
> I am not a CTech student but like VFX and I think Houdini is a great tool to get started.

* What do you think about Houdini as a tool for this class? Does the work with Houdini connect to the theoretical topics reasonably?
> I think Houdini works well with the topics discussed in this lecture, but I don't really have much to compare it to.

* Do you have any other ideas reading which tools and software packages to use for this class?
> No, not really.

* Do you have any useful hints to pass on to future students, e.g. utility tools, further resources?
> Hmm, when it comes to Houdini maybe turn off Auto Update haha.

* What is your opinion regarding practical exercises in class? Do you think it would be helpful to substitute some of the theory parts with doing e.g. an Houdini exercise in class (there can be no additional time for the class though, it is "either...or")?
> I think it makes sense to have a good amount of time for the theory in class. On the other hand, it would be useful to sit together
> when working with Houdini to help one another out with questions regarding the assignments.

* Which one was your favorite chapter, which one your least favorite?
> I was very interested in Dynamics, Particles and Fluids. My least favorite would be Shaders because I did not really
> get into it.

* Was there a topic missing and if so which one?
> No :)

* Please feel free to add any feedback you want to give!
> I liked the lectures at Filmuni a lot. Everyone – from teachers to students – was so nice and welcoming! Thanks Lena!!!
