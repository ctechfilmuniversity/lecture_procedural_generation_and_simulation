## Task 1 - Learning More About Fluids (or Ignoring Fluids and Working with Audio in Houdini)

### Option 1

* Read the original paper [Real-Time Fluid Dynamics for Games](https://www.dgp.toronto.edu/public_user/stam/reality/Research/pdf/GDC03.pdf) from Jos Stam
    * The additional resources in the slides might also help for a better understanding
* Start to implement the paper yourself
    * C++ is a good choice here!
    * For glsl you will probably need to use textures as data structures - manageable but an additional challenge
    * p5

Submit your code however far you got in the given as `pgs_ss22_08_lastname.xx`, and if possible image file as `pgs_ss22_08_lastname.png`.
