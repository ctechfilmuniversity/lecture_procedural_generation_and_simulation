Submit one stylized / artistic image that uses noise as generating principle or design element. You can find it on the internet.

I chose the work of the romanian painter Adrian Ghenie. I think what he does in traditional painting is exactly adding up this noise-layer to the very-representative-scene that he is portraying. 

For example this is the scene where Nicolae Ceausescu and his wife had the trial before their very-fast-paced death sentence.
