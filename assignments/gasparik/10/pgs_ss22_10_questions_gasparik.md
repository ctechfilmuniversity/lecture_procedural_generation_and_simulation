# Questions Final Session

## Question 1: Wrap-Up

* How would you rate the difficulty of this lecture from 1 (far too easy) to 5 (far too difficult)?

      3
* How would you rate the amount of work you had to put into this lecture so far from 1 (no work at all) to 5 (far too much work)?

      3
* How well did the given time estimates for each session match the time you needed to complete the session?

      It usually took me a bit more, to create something I was happy about, but was on a low level, it could've been manageable in the given time frame.
* What do you think about Houdini as tool to learn for a CTecht student? Is it valuable?

      I loved it, but I think a better render engine would've been helpful.
* What do you think about Houdini as a tool for this class? Does the work with Houdini connect to the theoretical topics reasonably?

      I find it one of the best tools for procedural creation, so it fits, I believe.
* Do you have any other ideas reading which tools and software packages to use for this class?

      TouchDesigner is also very powerful, and real-time.
* Do you have any useful hints to pass on to future students, e.g. utility tools, further resources?

* What is your opinion regarding practical exercises in class? Do you think it would be helpful to substitute some of the theory parts with doing e.g. an Houdini exercise in class (there can be no additional time for the class though, it is "either...or")?

      I find the theory very important, so I wouldn't substitute from that time, but an additional workshop would be nice. 
* Which one was your favorite chapter, which one your least favorite?

      I really liked all of them, but somehow the particles chapter with the coding part was the most satisfying. I've been using particles for a long time, but after the session I also understood the concept behind it, finally.
* Was there a topic missing and if so which one?

      Can't think of any.
* Please feel free to add any feedback you want to give!


## Question 2: Personal Reflection

In order to make the best possible use of the lecture, please reflect on the following questions. No need to submit anything, this is just for you.

Does it makes sense for you

* ...to have procedural generation in your set of skills?
    * If yes, with which tool do you want to work with?
    * Create your own outputs / designs / setups
* ...to have Houdini in your set of skills?
    * If yes, pick a topic to look into...
    * ...or start with doing once a complete tour through Houdini.
    * Have a individualized setup of project structure, view layouts, rendering setup, etc.
    * Keep notes on your insights
    * Create your own outputs / designs / setups
    * Get as much as possible into the procedural work flow
    * Use the shelf tools as little as possible 
* ...to have fragment shader programming / glsl in your set of skills?
    * If yes, pick an environment
    * Come to the shader workshop
    * Think about converting the topics that we worked on with Houdini to glsl
    * Look at examples and understand them
    * Create your own outputs / designs

Choose your next steps depending on your answers.
