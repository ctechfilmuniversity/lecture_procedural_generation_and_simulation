## 08_Swarm

I had issues with this assignment. At the point of changing the code to the finished version nothing moved anymore. I tried everything that I knew I could do, like clicking into the solver node and resetting the simulation, deleting and rewriting/copying the code and rewatching the part of teh tutorial before the issue again and again but it just didn't change anything. Then I redid the whole project until that point and it didn't work again. After I spend 5 hours on this I asked Marco W. for help and together we also didn't find the solution after 1 hour. He gave me his project, which worked and I started doing the rest from the point where it didn't work for me anymore. Since I was over time I didn't do a render but just a screenshot and a screen-recording.
