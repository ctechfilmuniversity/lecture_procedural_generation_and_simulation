# 09_Fluids

I read the paper because I want to understand how fluids work and then implement it ideally in GLSL or in three.js or OpenFrameworks. I spend 2.5 hours on reading and I didn't have time to implement anything but I think this was very interesting and helpful. 
I know this probably won't give me any points but I still wanted to say that I'm interested in this topic and I did spend my assignment time on this, I just don't have a result.
