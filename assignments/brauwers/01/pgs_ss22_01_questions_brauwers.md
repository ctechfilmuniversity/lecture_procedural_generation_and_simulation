## Questions 2 - Procedural Generation

Briefly in your own words: how would you explain your granny what *procedural generation* means? 
    
   
## Questions 3 - Patterns

### 3.1 Seeing Patterns

Take at least three pictures of natural patterns and at least three pictures of man-made ones (patterns can be two or three dimensional). Try to include at least one pattern with self-similarity. Taking the pictures with your smart phone is just fine. Link all images in this markdown file.

(this picture is older, I just wanted to include it, because I like that there are three patterns in different areas of the picture)

### 3.2 Understanding and Implementing Patterns

Write for one of your pattern images a generating algorithm in pseudo-code or code. Submit the code below.

### 3.3 Seeing Faces

As an exercise to see and understand the environment around you (and to have some fun ðŸ˜Š), try to find at least two faces. Link all images in this file.

## Questions 4 - Abstraction

### 4.1 Abstraction in Art

Chose one "traditional" painting, which is inspirational to you. The image can come from the script or you can refer to any artists or image you like.  

Explain briefly what you like about the painting and how it might inspire you for your own work.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66121204/166156529-0a59143b-485a-4327-915d-f40717e4f1fb.png" alt="" width="45%"/>

I understood the word "traditional" in the way that it means traditional forms of art like painting on a canvas instead of historic paintings. This painting is called "Preservation"(2022) by Darin Cooper (*2000). I choose this painting because I love the colors, which beautifully melt together. To me it has an impactful intesity while seeming vulnerable. It's abstract and has a lot of variation of colors and "shapes" without being repetetive. The only thing that isn't abstract is a face behind a red piece of plastic which makes it mixed-media. I saw this live and it's size makes it even more impressive to me.


### 4.2 Abstracted Artistic Expression in CGI

Chose one CG image, which you like and of which you think that it has an artistic quality to it. The image doesn't need to be from the script, again you can chose any CGI image you like (it should use 3D graphics). You can find more examples in the [Summary of Artists](../../02_scripts/pgs_ss22_01_intro_script.md#summary-of-artists) section.

Iconographies by Quayola. (https://quayola.com/work/series/iconographies-series.php)

Explain briefly what you like about the image and why you consider it to be somewhat a pice of art. 

I chose this artwork (and I hope it's considered 3D) because its abstract art based on a historic painting. It looks 3D even when printed on a 2d surface because of the polygon structure and the vibrant colors that seem like they're growing out of the "canvas". I think all of the images from that series are beautiful and interesting.
