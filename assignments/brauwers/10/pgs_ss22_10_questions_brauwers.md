## Question 1: Wrap-Up

* How would you rate the difficulty of this lecture from 1 (far too easy) to 5 (far too difficult)?
  * For me it is a 4, just because Houdini was so hard for me.    
* How would you rate the amount of work you had to put into this lecture so far from 1 (no work at all) to 5 (far too much work)?
  * also a 4-5, because I often had to either stop doing the assigment after the recommended time or work on it a few hours more.
* How well did the given time estimates for each session match the time you needed to complete the session?
  * I answered that in the previous question. I appreciate the time estimates, because I may would have been discouraged by the amount of time I had to spend on the assignments, if I didn't have an estimate.
* What do you think about Houdini as tool to learn for a CTecht student? Is it valuable?
  * for some I know it is, for me it isn't. 
* What do you think about Houdini as a tool for this class? Does the work with Houdini connect to the theoretical topics reasonably?
  * yes
* Do you have any other ideas reading which tools and software packages to use for this class?
  * I would have prefered GLSL as the tool for this class or an option for each assignment to do a GLSL task instead.
* Do you have any useful hints to pass on to future students, e.g. utility tools, further resources?
  * talk to the other students! that helped me a lot
* What is your opinion regarding practical exercises in class? Do you think it would be helpful to substitute some of the theory parts with doing e.g. an Houdini exercise in class (there can be no additional time for the class though, it is "either...or")?
  * I liked the classes as they were. My favorite session was session 04. I don't think I would have liked doing Houdini in class but maybe it would have helped me when running into issues. 
* Which one was your favorite chapter, which one your least favorite?
  * favorite 04 because of GLSL. I also started writing the code you wrote in class and that was fun and helpful for understanding.
  * 2. favorite: tilings
  * no least favorite session I enjoyed all of them, my least favorite thing about this class were all of the houdini assignments, (except for the first one), because I don't like Houdini. 
* Was there a topic missing and if so which one?
  * / 
* Please feel free to add any feedback you want to give!
