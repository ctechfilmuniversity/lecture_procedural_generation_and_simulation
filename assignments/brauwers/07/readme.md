# 07_Dynamics

I ran into a problem with this assignment. This time it wasn't a (to me) mysterious Houdini problem that I coudn't figure out. For the most part this tutorial worked well for me but when we had to add the fake_gravity I tried a lot but since I didn't fully understand what to do I couldn't figure it out by myself. Marco W. helped me but doing it together it still didn't look like in the example. I stopped after 3 hours and didn't do a render.
