# Introduction

* Patterns

???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* What is a pattern?
    * Repetitive structures that follow some sort of creation principles.
    * Mandelbrot: Bottomless wonders spring from simple rules, which are repeated without end.

--
* Self-Similarity

???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* What means Self-Similarity?
    * In mathematics, a self-similar object is exactly or approximately similar to a part of itself (i.e., the whole has the same shape as one or more of the parts). Many objects in the real world, such as coastlines, are statistically self-similar: parts of them show the same statistical properties at many scales.

--
* Abstractions

???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* What is an abstraction?
    * Breaking with e.g. visuals from reality
    * Abstraction came to live when artists moved away from visually representing reality in a literal fashion.
    * With the start of the last century, artists broke with visuals from reality and became more and more *non-representational*. Also, in terms of meaning artist broke free and did not aim to convey a certain, specific *subject matter* anymore. Instead, artist rely on form, color, or technique to engage the viewer on a more *intuitive* level.

* Procedural Generation


???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* Show homework
* Advantages
    * Compactness
        * Few kilobytes for textures and volumes
    * Continuous and¬†multi-resolution
        * Any resolution
        * Any extent
        * E.g. for VR scenes
    * Potentially randomly accessible
        * Meaning, you can for example compute the color value for one pixel of a rasterimage independently from all other pixel in no particular order.
        * It can be evaluated in a constant time, regardless of the location of the point of evaluation, and regardless of previous evaluations.
        * Harness the power of multi-pipe GPU‚Äôs and multi-core CPU‚Äôs.
    * Parametrized
        * Often specify a whole visual category or class with controlling large amounts of details
        * Fast to interact with and flexible, e.g. in an interactive system
        * Remain editable throughout an entire visual effect production pipeline for example
* Disadvantages
    * Parametrized
        * Non-intuitive
            * Too abstract characteristics of the underlying functions (e.g. *frequency*)
            * Overlapping effects
        * Too little control
            * Surprising results can also be seen as positive
            * Almost never allow per-pixel control of the output 
        * Time-consuming exploration
    * Implementation effort
    * Limited design space
    * Potential evaluation time issues
    * Potential aliasing issues

???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* Harry Houdini (March 24, 1874 ‚Äì October 31, 1926) was a Hungarian-born American illusionist and stunt performer, noted for his sensational escape acts. [[Wiki: Harry Houdini]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Houdini)
* An old trick well done is far better than a new trick with no effect. - Harry Houdini
* Unfortunately, this friendly fella is not topic of our lecture.

--

* Started in 1986 and the software is under active development

???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* Version of it differ greatly, be aware of that when you for example do a tutorial for it, which might be based on an older version.

--
* SideFX offers a full free version: [Houdini Apprentice](https://www.sidefx.com/products/houdini-apprentice/)

???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* Next to the fact that you are not allowed to used the free version for any commercial work, you can only render up to 1280x720 with a watermark 

--
* Comes with the Mantra renderer


???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* Explain the principle of renderers
* Mention that rendering is often not part of the tutorials
* With the free version you can not include third party renderers

## Why Houdini?

Introduction to a 3D offline rendering package such as Blender, Maya, 3dsMax, Cinema4D, or Houdini.


???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* Explain the different packages

---
.header[Houdini]

## Why Houdini?

--

Houdini represents the procedural generation paradigm with a node-based system.

--

## Why Houdini?

Houdini represents the procedural generation paradigm with a node-based system.

<img src="img/02/houdini_04.png" alt="houdini_04" style="width:30%;">  [[cg.tuwien]](https://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/courses/Visualisierung2/HallOfFame/2018/OtherTopic02/html/detail.html)

* Every action is stored in a node

--
* Nodes are wired into networks

--
* Nodes can save and pass information

--
* Networks define a recipe

--
* Networks can be repeated, tweaked, etc.


---
.header[Houdini]

## Why Houdini?

Houdini represents the procedural generation paradigm with a node-based system.

--

This is a very different approach in comparison to the other 3D programs, which usually only come with a very limitedly accessible creation stack.

--

---
.header[Houdini]

## Why Houdini?

Houdini supports a deep integration of Houdini and its procedural workflow within larger pipelines. 

--

For example there is a plug-in that allows the integration of Houdini technology into Unreal, etc.

--

.center[<img src="img/02/houdini_05.png" alt="houdini_05" style="width:100%;">  [[cg.tuwien]](https://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/courses/Visualisierung2/HallOfFame/2018/OtherTopic02/html/detail.html)]

.header[Houdini]

## Workflows

--

To adhere to a procedural workflow:

--

* Always think about your work as creating a process, rather than a thing
    * For example, don't make a table, but a procedure that builds tables and which is adaptable
--
* Avoid viewport tool interactions and input

--
* Avoid traditional box modeling workflows

--
* Avoid modeling operations that are dependent on specific point or primitive numbers

--
* Think about what needs manual art-direction and what can be left to your system to handle

--
* Changes upstream should never break the network downstream

---
.header[Houdini]

## Rendering

--

For offline render packages such as Houdini, you can chose different render engines.

--

The renderer takes the scene in Houdini and computes an image and / or different render passes from the 3D representation.

--

Houdini is shipped with the Mantra render engine.


???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* Mantra is a renderer that utilizes scanline, raytracing, and physically-based rendering. Physically based rendering (PBR) as many of you probably know, refers to the use of realistic shading/lighting models along with measured surface values in representing real-world materials accurately. Because PBR is more conceptual than it is a strict set of rules, PBR implementation systems (and results) tend to vary.

--

It also supports

* Redshift
* RenderMan
* Arnold
* OctaneRender
* V-Ray

???
.task[COMMENT:] 

* Renderman, Arnold, Mantra are a CPU-based renderer
* V-Ray, Redshift, Octane and Arnold GPU can also use the GPU for rendering

--

As we are working with the Apprentice version, we can only work with the Mantra renderer for now.

.task[COMMENT:]  

* https://www.skytopia.com/project/fractal/2mandelbulb.html


<!-- Board:

This happens in the world of complex numbers
Numbers of the form a + bi plotted on a complex plane
a, and b are real numbers, i^2 = -1

Mandelbrot: we have complex number c and function f_c(z) = z^2 + c
Look at the behavior of 0 under the iteration of f_c (what happens if I take 0 and plug it into the function?) and I keep doing that to the result

f_1(z) = z^2 + 1

f_1(0) = 0^2 + 1 -> 1
f_1(1) = 1^2 + 1 -> 2
f_1(2) = 2^2 + 1 -> 5
f_1(5) = 5^2 + 1 -> 26

What happens to the size of the result? The magnitude (the distances of a and b on the plane). Do they blow up or stay bounded?

The above is the ‚Äúblowing up‚Äù case

The bounded case, e.g. happens for c = -1

f_-1(0) = 0^2 + -1 -> -1
f_-1(-1) = -1^2 + -1 -> 0
f_-1(0) = 0^2 + -1 -> -1



The Mandelbrot set defines only numbers that are bounded (never larger than 2)

For the pretty pictures you color complex number on the complex plane depending in this behavior

The boundaries are where it gets interesting: when you move c a little you can‚Äôt predict what happens
