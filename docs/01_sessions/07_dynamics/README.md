# Procedural Generation and Simulation

Prof. Dr. Lena Gieseke \| l.gieseke@filmuniversitaet.de \| Film University Babelsberg KONRAD WOLF

# Session 07

We will discuss this session on **Monday, June 27th**.   

This session should take less than 4h.

## Task 1: Chapter 07 - Dynamics

* Read [Chapter 07 - Dynamics](../../02_scripts/pgs_ss22_06_dynamics_script.md)

## Task 2: A Basic Force Setup

* Complete the [Houdini Tutorial - A Basic Force Setup](pgs_ss22_tutorial_04_dynamics.md)

Submit your houdini file as `pgs_ss22_tutorial_04_lastname.hipnc`, at least one image file as `pgs_ss22_tutorial_04_lastname.png` and one animation as `pgs_ss22_tutorial_04_lastname.gif`.

## Task 3: Intro Rigid Body Dynamics

There are vast possibilities to work with build-in force-based systems in Houdini. For this task you should explore as first introduction force-based systems in Houdini.  

The [Houdini Tutorial - Intro Rigid Body Dynamics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yxue9XAiQ) is a good introduction and fairly well explained. I recommend that you complete this tutorial. If some of the terms in the tutorial feel foreign to you, feel free to look them up in the [Houdini documentation](https://www.sidefx.com/docs/houdini/index.html).

If you prefer to do a different tutorial, you can. The tutorial should be somewhat connected to a dynamic system, ideally using forces (however, keep in mind that we will get into particles next week). Some options could be (I haven't completed these):

* [Houdini Tutorial: Breaking Glue with Forces](https://diffusefx.com/2020/07/23/tutorial-breaking-glue-with-fields/)
* [Building Constraint Networks For Rigid Body Simulations](https://vimeo.com/270764227)
* [Houdini Tutorial: FLIP Interface Reactions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbpnGHacARo)
* [Finite Element Solver Tutorial](https://diffusefx.com/2020/05/05/fem-tutorial/)
* [Rigid Body Simulation with Glue Constraints](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjRlqjmoEOg&t=0s), [Control Destruction with Force Fields in Houdini Simulations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PH-GnpAaLhI&t=0s), [Control How Glue Constraints Break in Destruction Simulations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S7AxS7Xjq4&t=0s)
* [Splintering a Wooden Fence With Rigid Body Simulations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyDeW7EiDsg)

If you chose your own tutorial, also submit a link to the tutorial you followed.  

You are not required (but encouraged!) to submit a proper rendering. However, for this exercise a flipbook rendering of the simulation is just fine.

Submit your houdini file as `pgs_ss22_dynamics_lastname.hipnc`, at least one image file as `pgs_ss22_dynamics_lastname.png` and one animation as `pgs_ss22_dynamics_lastname.gif`.
