Answer all questions directly in a copy of the `pgs_ss22_XX_questions.md` file and also link and display your images in that file. 

Submit your copy as `pgs_ss22_XX_questions_lastname.md` in your assignments folder in a separate folder for each session. I prefer only lower-case characters.

For example: `assignments/gieseke/01/pgs_ss22_01_questions_gieseke.md`
