##  Task 2: Final Mini Project

The final project of this lecture is due July 31st. It should be manageable **in less than 16h**, meaning in less than two days of work. The project must refer to one of the lecture topics. It doesn't need to be done in Houdini. Do what you want. You can also base your project on a tutorial from the internet. The result of the tutorial will not be enough however, you have to develop the project somehow further and make it your own. Googling a specific term and looking for youtube videos usually gives already many results. Some further valuable resources are:

* [Houdini Hive 2020](https://www.sidefx.com/houdini-hive/houdini-hive-worldwide/), [Houdini Hive Europe](https://www.sidefx.com/houdini-hive/houdini-hive-europe/)
* The [offical collections](https://www.sidefx.com/tutorials/) of tutorials on the SideFX site
* The [Houdini Foundations](https://www.sidefx.com/tutorials/houdini-foundations-book/) book
* [Entagma](http://www.entagma.com/)
* [CG Wiki](https://www.tokeru.com/cgwiki/?title=Houdini)
    * To me this is the best learning resource on the web but topics have more of an exercise character to them and unfortunately are not well structured.
    * You can chose to do e.g. all exercises to a certain topic.

* [Doxia Studio](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYFRTyKDYUe4R2OgBVZUORA)
* [Niels Prayer](https://www.sidefx.com/tutorials/author/Niels%20PRAYER/)
* [Mix Training](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC65D7DvzyyGEqIJVxK-XhDg/videos)
* [Rohan Dalvi](http://www.rohandalvi.net/free)
* [Houdini Engine for Unity](https://www.sidefx.com/products/houdini-engine/plug-ins/unity-plug-in/)
* ...

*Hints:*

* Do not underestimate the time it takes to find a good tutorial.
* Before you commit to a tutorial check the comments to see what kind of feedback the tutorial received.
* Double-check what the tutorial results in (e.g. by watching the last minute first). Oftentimes the preview image of a tutorial will be super nice but the tutorial itself usually does not cover the shading and rendering setup - which is fine but be aware of it in advance.

Submit all source files, at least one representative image, a movie (if applicable) and a short project description as `.md`, **briefly** covering the following aspects:

* Abstract
* Concept
* Implementation
* Results
* Project Reflection & Discussion
* Lessons Learned

Submit your final project as assignment 10.
