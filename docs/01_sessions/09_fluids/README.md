# Procedural Generation and Simulation

Prof. Dr. Lena Gieseke \| l.gieseke@filmuniversitaet.de \| Film University Babelsberg KONRAD WOLF

# Session 08

This session should take less than 3h.


## Task 1 - Learning More About Fluids

### Option 1

* Read the original paper [Real-Time Fluid Dynamics for Games](https://www.dgp.toronto.edu/public_user/stam/reality/Research/pdf/GDC03.pdf) from Jos Stam
    * The additional resources in the slides might also help for a better understanding
* Start to implement the paper yourself
    * C++ is a good choice here!
    * For glsl you will probably need to use textures as data structures - manageable but an additional challenge
    * p5

Submit your code however far you got in the given as `pgs_ss22_08_lastname.xx`, and if possible image file as `pgs_ss22_08_lastname.png`.

### Option 2

Chose any fluid-related Houdini tutorial. For example:

* [Doxia Studio: Mix Fluids From Image](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT4mZphB154&t=230s)
* [VoxelFX: Introduction to fluid simulations #1 - FLIP fluid tools - Houdini 18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQXS12sj9IA&t=42s), [#2 - Colliders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H1EWhvMewk), [#3 - Forces](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAio77ZdKos)
* [Houdini Liquid Flow Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0QzfR-i2Os)
* [CG Wiki - Flip Fluids](https://www.tokeru.com/cgwiki/index.php?title=HoudiniDops#Flip)
* ...

Submit your houdini file as `pgs_ss22_08_lastname.hipnc` and at least one image file as `pgs_ss22_08_lastname.png`.
