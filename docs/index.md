This course introduces participants to procedural and simulation algorithms for 2D and 3D graphics. Focus lies on the creation of patterns and abstracted design. Topics are reflected from all sides: their underlying formal theories, their practical implementations as well as their design. Different implementation frameworks can be used, the course focuses on Houdini and GLSL.

## Learning Objectives

* Overview about techniques and their capabilities
* Understanding of formal theories and algorithms
* Practical implementation experiences
* Implementation of specific design goals

## Time and Place

* Mondays, 10.00-13.30, room 6119
    * 9 sessions in total
* 3 SWS, 4 ECTS

## Method of Instruction

The class is conducted as lectures with exercises.

Please note that the chapters and their order are subject to change!

## Final Exercise

* The last exercise is mandatory to pass the class.
* It should be manageable **in less than 16h**, meaning in two days of work.
* The project must refer to one of the lecture topics. You can come up with your own task or I will make suggestions.
* You can also base your project on a tutorial from the internet. The result of the tutorial will not be enough however, you have to develop the project somehow further and make it your own. 
* The (hard) deadline for the final exercise is **July 31st**.

## Evaluation

Each session results in 10 points, unless specifically stated otherwise. The final exercise counts for 30 points.

The requirements to pass the course are

* at least 4 completed sessions with at least 70% of the points
* the final exercise, which is an individually chosen task.

There will be a grade. 

### Grading

The grade is computed from the assignment points and the final exercise:

* Only 50% of all points are needed to get a 1.7, and
* you can hand in exercise results up until July 31st to make them count (this is a hard deadline).

### Criteria

As the exercises might be relatively open-ended problems, the grading criteria are based on

* conceptual mastery,
* engineering effort, code / setup organization, code / setup quality, and
* the (e.g. visual) quality.

Some tasks might have specific grading criteria, which are then indicated per task.


## Materials

* On Monday all session materials are published for the following week.
* Usually, we will discuss the results of the assignments the following Monday.
* You hand in all materials through GitHub.

### Structure

Materials are structured as follows:

* In [`01_sessions`](../01_sessions) you find a [folder](../01_sessions/01/) with an index for each week (session = week).
* The [README.md](../01_sessions/01/README.md) in each session folder gives you an overview of all the readings, assignments, practical exercises, etc. that you have to do for that week - it is your todo list! I recommend to start your work with going through that file.
* The [pgs_ss1_xx_questions.md](../01_sessions/01/pgs_ss1_01_questions.md) files separate all tasks for which you have to write something. You should make a copy of that file and write and submit your answers as a copy of that file.
* In [`02_scripts`](../02_scripts) you find all scripts.
* In [`03_assignments`](../03_assignments) you submit your work each week to the folder with your last name and a folder with the session index. You will submit all assignments to the same folder (the one with your last name).
